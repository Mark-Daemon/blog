    <div class="post-excerpt">
        <h2>Human Collaboration at Scale without Intelligent Design</h2><p>Having recently rewatched "The Big Short" with family, I've thought about the nature of conspiracies. The popular view portrays conspiracies as centrally planned, top-down operations carefully orchestrated by intelligent actors working in secrecy. Dramatic but not a complete reflection of the real world. Rather than intelligent design, conspiracies can resemble markets: they emerge naturally from the collective behaviour of groups pursuing their own interests.<br /> This emergent view better explains some observed phenomena and also provides a more useful framework for understanding how complex systems of deception arise in human society.</p><p>Consider how criminal networks evolve. A local drug operation doesn't begin with a grand vision of international trade. Instead, it starts with profit-seeking behaviour confined to a local level. As these groups scale up, they optimise their supply chains, leading to increasingly international connections. These connections form organically through the pursuit of mutually beneficial deals. When local distributors realise they can get better prices from an international seller, that seller sees an opportunity to expand into another country, and a connection is made. By having this process play out across thousands of actors, a complex international network is built without anyone explicitly designing it.<br /> This emergent structure makes these networks resilient - when law enforcement succeeds in arresting leading members, the network often quickly reorganises and continues operating. The War on Drugs provides another example: despite numerous high-profile arrests, the drug trade perseveres.</p><p>This emergence of complex order from simple rules parallels Nick Land's observations about economic markets functioning as a form of artificial intelligence. Economic pricing data reflects countless factors - weather patterns, political events, tech innovation, etc - beyond what is possible by independent human effort.<br /> This intelligence emerges naturally from the distributed actions of market participants, each acting on their own local information. Criminal networks follow this same model: individual actors make decisions based on their local knowledge, creating a distributed network of information and action that no single participant fully comprehends. This decentralised nature makes the network resilient - when law enforcement targets specific individuals or groups, the network adapts and continues operating, demonstrating an almost organic ability to heal and reorganise.</p><p>The narrative of "The Big Short" emphasises how many bankers trading mortgage-backed securities didn't fully understand what they were doing. Yet their collective actions maintained a complex system of fraud.<br /> Each actor - from mortgage brokers to rating agencies to investment banks - simply followed their immediate incentives. For instance, Rating agencies, dependent on banks for business, had clear motivation to provide favourable ratings.<br /> No one needed to understand the whole picture or intent for the overall outcome for the system to function as a de facto conspiracy.<br /> The conspiracy was an emergent phenomenon of misaligned systemic incentives within the banking industry, that so few individuals faced real punishment reflects a failure to disincentivise the behaviour.</p><p>Broadly speaking, conspiracies are an extension of human collaboration adapting to and exploiting societal systems. Forming social groups to pursue an objective is a natural human instinct - it doesn't take a genius to coordinate such an action. Through a Darwinian trial and error process, these groups uncover ways to manipulate outcomes - often guided by unintended incentives already present. Thus, these incentives shape the conspiracies that will emerge.</p><p>In summary, conspiracy need not be a top-down, centralised design. Their emergence is expected and reflects unintended incentives within the system. Consequently, it is not necessarily a question of "who" is behind a conspiracy but "how" it has emerged and organised. The next question is: how do you disincentivise this when the system rewards it?</p>
