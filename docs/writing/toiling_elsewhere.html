        <p>Sterile off-white lamps illuminate two faceless figures in white full-body gear. Only their eyes are visible behind the two view-ports of their filtered masks. Around them, an abundant garden is fed by a vast network of irrigation pipes that feed into towers of pods overflowing with vegetation.</p><p>"I'm thinking of changing career paths," Harry, the taller figure, says as he patches the pipe above him.<br /> "Yeah? What did you have in mind?" the shorter replies, his attention focused on the humidity sensors embedded in the pod's soil.<br /> "Factory tech. I've been in irrigation for so long. I figured I could do it with a change," Harry answers. His dark blue eyes and broad contour distinguish him from his similarly clad colleague.<br /> "You'd be risking a step backwards in your career," Sam warns, his green eyes still firmly on his sensors, "and worse, a smaller paycheck".<br /> "The jobs have transferable skills in common. I'll negotiate to avoid too big a pay cut". Harry leans out from under the piping, glancing over the warehouse, and sighs. "Sam, I'm so bored of all this; I'd be willing to accept a small cut".<br /> After scribbling a quick note, Sam turns his attention to his friend, his tone more serious. "You've settled into a routine. The factory will have some novelty, but that's less pay for more effort. Are you sure you want to do that?"<br /> "I've also considered management, or warmed to the idea at least. Less telling people what to do, more coordinating work between skilled workers. That's a respectable skill".<br /> "That sounds like a good step; it'd certainly keep you busy". Sam pauses to adjust his mask, looking to rid himself of the smell of heated plastic that bypassed the filter. "So, why aren't you aiming for management?"<br /> "I have a romanticised view of the work. The idea of letting my technical skills dull... I don't like it. Factory tech is still very technical. The experience could make me a better manager in the long run".<br /> Sam grunts, "Fair enough, fair enough".</p><p>The conversation lulls, but neither returns to their tasks. Instead opting to look out across the warehouse. Bright artificial lighting cascades down over LED colour-coded systems. The colours change daily, reflecting the latest statistical tests the automated farming system runs. Few jobs besides maintenance still require human input.</p><p>"I've also thought of leaving, Harry," Sam's eyes are focused across the warehouse floor. "Not to be a factory tech or a manager but to have my own pod-farm, my own workers. Maybe, not even a pod-farm. My own factory".<br /> "Ambitious". Harry turns to Sam, curiosity in his eyes.<br /> "I have the capital, but it's a risk; the large corps picked all the low-hanging fruit long ago. I would need an edge. A more productive harvest, better testing, better marketing, lower overhead, and somehow afford better machinery. It's too much, and I find myself thinking...".<br /> "Of our nice, comfortable paycheck?" Harry interrupts with a light chuckle, "hell, that wife of yours may want children soon; that'll give you some novelty". The two men exchange a laugh, each feeling the weight of their plastic uniform under the synthetic heat. The smile relieves some tension from Sam's eyes, though they remain overcast.<br /> "That does worry me. They say having children is the end of a man. You can climb that social ladder, but not much further once children are in the picture".<br /> "Children are a commitment", Harry replies, his tone more mellowed and serious, beginning to match Sam's. "It sounds like you're not ready for that".</p><p>Sam continues to chuckle half-heartedly, turning his attention downwards to his boots.<br /> "I've been reading this German writer. He doesn't ask whether we are free or if we should be free, but what we are free for. As if challenging you: Does your vision and ability merit freedom?"</p><p>Sam lifts his hands, palms facing upwards, inspecting the dirt embedded in the plastic gloves. Their shadow flat on the soil below.</p><p>"And here we are, toiling in this warehouse. We can't even imagine leaving it, not really. He writes of deciding our own virtues, our own good and evil. Yet all that ambition of mine would just have me toiling somewhere else".</p>
