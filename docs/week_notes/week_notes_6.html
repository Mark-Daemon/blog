    <div class="post-excerpt">
        <h2>Work</h2><p>Gears have shifted a bit with my volunteer work at [REDACTED]. With the K8S work done, I am now exploring integrating the Medusa store-front with Ory for authentication and user management. Both are headless solutions, and Medusa looks comfortably flexible with plugin support (as opposed to Ghost CMS, which is a pain on that front). I did an initial bit of digging to get a feel for where to start, but now I have a plan sorted (registration plugin to integrate with Ory).</p><h2>Media</h2><h4>Algorithmic Learning in a Random World</h4><p>The general gist is to provide a confidence interval for machine learning algorithms dubbed conformal prediction. This is similar to what is used with Bayesian modelling, but the interval is determined by the similarity to already seen data points rather than the model set distributions. This comes with some nice properties - namely, the data determines the confidence interval whilst considering how "familiar" a particular data point is.</p><p>The first several chapters introduce the concept of conformity - how similar data points are to one another. It then builds towards how we can apply this to determine confidence intervals for an underlining predictor - in short, how well did we predict the similar data points in our training set? The authors dive deep into the topic, exploring the formulas in detail, looking into asymptotic performance and backing their claims with mathematical proofs. The downside is that this drags on a bit, and you may start to miss the forest from the trees. However, from chapter 8 onwards, the book shifts into high gear again.</p><p>From Chapter 8, tests for exchangeability using martingale tests are introduced - in short, detecting when your algorithm needs to be retrained for whatever reason (concept shift, label shift, etc.). Note: martingale here as in the stochastic process, not the better-known betting strategy. The idea is to "place bets" against the underlining model predictions - should the martingale property be violated (E[M[n + 1]] = M[n]), then exchangeability has been violated. Once again, they go into great depth exploring this (I particularly liked the properties super-martingales provide regarding bounding - i.e. Ville's inequality). However, it doesn't end there.</p><p>Given we can detect when the algorithm is suffering from some imbalance, we can use this mechanism to course-correct with "protected prediction algorithms". Leveraging the martingale exchangeability tests, we can also derive the direction of the inaccuracy, allowing us to nudge the prediction in the right direction. This, of course, comes at a price. However, it is presented as a technique to be relied upon while the underlying predictor is undergoing retraining.</p><p>The authors provide an ending theory chapter covering the base probability-related topics they build upon to develop their conformal predictors. In hindsight, I should have given this a flick earlier to set the context for the book. I recommend starting here and reviewing any concepts you are unfamiliar with.</p><p>Overall, I enjoyed this book, particularly from chapter 8 onwards. The ideas are well-founded and have shaped my approach to building prediction systems. There is enough value here that I am surprised my more data-science / data-engineering friends didn't already have this on their radar. If you are someone who builds prediction systems, then I highly recommend this book.</p><h2>Personal</h2><p>I have been pondering Nick Land's thoughts on Exit being a more influential move than Voice (voting with your feet carrying more weight than reforming a system from within / democratically).</p><p>Looking at the situation in the UK, it becomes apparent that there are filters in place to avoid reform.<br /> Attempting to address these issues directly will invite media smears, attacks on your career, and potentially risk a knock on the door from the police. The latest clamp-down on speech strikes me as an attempt to maintain control of a slowly deteriorating situation. To be rather Hitchens about it, is it worth the effort at this stage?</p><p>Even if the segment of the population who have taken us down this self-destructive path is removed from power, they will continue to agitate for these same ends - their beliefs may be harmful, but they are genuinely held.<br /> I am not keen to tie my personal fate to such people. Given they will not leave, it may be time to look for the door.</p><h4>3D Printing</h4><p>After seeing a <a href='https://makerworld.com/en/models/565019-quiet-from-metal-gear-solid?from=search#profileId-484615'>picture</a> of Quiet from MGSV, I took an interest in printing similar 3d art pieces. I wrote a small script for rendering an estimation of what a height map image will look like with layers printed in different colours (Bambu Studio displays the colours but doesn't display the blending between layers satisfactorily). You can find my script and a description of my approach <a href='/blog/tools/stl_colour_preview.html'>here</a>.</p><p>I took a well-known image from the latest Deus Ex game and applied a mosaic effect to improve blending. The results are below (alongside the initial Quiet print):</p><p><img src="/blog/image/week_notes_6/quiet.jpg" alt="Quiet"  style="width: 250px;"/> <div class="grid-container"> <img src="/blog/image/week_notes_6/deus_ex_red.jpg" alt="Deux Ex Red"  style="height: 220px;"/> <img src="/blog/image/week_notes_6/deus_ex_blue.jpg" alt="Deus Ex Blue"  style="height: 220px;"/> </div></p><h4>Kotlin Bridge for Stan</h4><p>The Kotlin support for C is surprisingly good - it almost works out of the box. You point at the locally installed C headers, and it generates the bindings for you. However, it is limited to processing C headers.</p><p>The problem is: Stan does not offer C headers - only C++ headers that Kotlin cinterop cannot parse. This leaves two feasible approaches: make use of CmdStan (which would not benefit from Kotlin's native interop) or write a C interface for Stan (too large of a job).</p><p>It's a shame, but I will be putting this project down. Should Kotlin extend its cinterop support to C++, I will consider picking this up again.</p>
