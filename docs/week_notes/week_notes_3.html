    <div class="post-excerpt">
        <h2>Work</h2><p>A former Russian colleague of mine had been living in Dubai to avoid the ongoing war. He has recently moved to London, so we were able to grab a bite. It had been a fair few years since we last met.<br /> While reminiscing about old times, he shared a story about his politically active days in Russia. There was a protest regarding the Navalny arrest, and he had filmed it with his drone. The media then reported the crowd as being small and insubstantial. So, he shared his footage with some alternative media outlets and made headlines.<br /> I also learnt another Russian colleague of ours is a qualified Tank Officer from back in his military training days. It's funny; we are building systems for managing financial transactions together.</p><p>Volunteering with [REDACTED] has hit a standstill. Our key front-end developer has unexpectedly dropped off the project without pushing his changes. We're hoping this is a temporary issue. This is often the trouble with online volunteer-backed projects.</p><h2>Media</h2><h4>Think Bayes by Allen B. Downey</h4><p>The book focuses on Grid Approximation as a tool for teaching Bayesian statistics. It's a relatively short read and is a fantastic introduction to the topic.</p><p>I had previously overlooked GA (Grid Approximation) as a method, preferring MCMC methods for their flexibility. However, as a tool for learning the topic, GA provides a much clearer understanding of the underlying mechanics (MCMC can sometimes seem a bit magical). Having the student manually step through building a prior, applying an update, and then analysing the resulting posterior provides a clear step-by-step understanding of the mechanisms at play. For practical problems, GA is still hindered by its inability to scale with model complexity. However, for simpler models, it avoids many of the sampling issues associated with MCMC.</p><p>The book touches upon PyMC, a favourite of mine, but it does not do so in depth. Yet, this feels appropriate, given the scope of the book. For those interested, I would recommend following on with a personal favourite: <em>Statistical Rethinking</em>. It focuses much more on applying MCMC methods in R (it has a PyMC translation).</p><p>I particularly enjoyed the practice problems that explain the theory throughout each chapter. It's a nice hands-on way to introduce each new topic. I wrote my empirical distribution library in Kotlin to follow along (which amounted to simple functions around HashMaps). This left me wanting more, so I started looking into what to read next. For the case studies I found <em>Statistical Case Studies: A Collaboration Between Academe and Industry</em>. I would also like to do a deeper dive into PyMC with <em>Bayesian Modeling and Computation in Python</em>, written by one of the libraries contributors.</p><h4>The Principles of Modern Economics by Tyler Cowen, Alex Tabarrok</h4><p>I already have some thoughts about 30% of the way through this book. I picked this up as my background leans more mathematical rather than economic, and I wanted a more formal introduction.</p><p>The introduction to Comparative Advantage was a bit of a let-down. The claims made were rather grandiose compared to the simplistic underlining models. Comparative Advantage doesn't explain China's trajectory relative to the US. However, digging into this led me down a deeper rabbit hole - starting with the original author, David Ricardo.</p><p>Ricardo lived in the late 18th century to early 19th century, at a time when Britain was still transitioning from a predominantly agricultural economy to an industrial one. One of his interesting observations was that population growth would lead to higher costs for food, as the demand for food would lead to the cultivation of less fertile land (aligning with Malthusianism). His involvement in the Corn Laws is also interesting - but back to Comparative Advantage.<br /> Regarding Comparative Advantage, Ricardo stipulates certain conditions. A major one is that capital is immobile; otherwise, this would lead to offshoring (prescient). During the Corn Law debates, he also argued that not placing tariffs on foreign corn would lead to winners and losers (consumers vs producers). As such, a gradual transition would be preferable. However, I was surprised to not find any mention of potential geopolitical risks.</p><p>One of the book's authors, Tyler Cowen, similarly finds Comparative Advantage to be somewhat lacking (see <a href='https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2013/09/why-the-theory-of-comparative-advantage-is-overrated.html'>link</a>).</p><p>Along a long dive into supply-demand curves, the authors touch upon monopolies. They argue that monopolies are both a trade-off for R&D investment but are also bad as they are economically inefficient. Inefficient, although they produce greater profits for the monopolist, they reduce overall economic output by leaving unmet consumer demand. A similar situation occurs when the social cost of production is not reflected in the price of the good - overall economic output is reduced. This has left me thinking about companies like Deliveroo: does the social cost they incur with foreign workers make them economically inefficient?<br /> Perhaps I will write a longer piece on this.</p><h2>Personal</h2><p>My in-laws' dog passed away this week. A sad and rather grim event. She had been diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer. I came over to help them move the body to the garage for the night. She had a blanket over her, and her body was already beginning to smell of decay (she used to smell faintly of sausage rolls). As we moved her, blood began to pour out of her mouth. She was a lovely dog, and seeing her in that state pained me.<br /> Handling dead bodies is never pleasant; everything tastes of death for a while afterwards.</p>
