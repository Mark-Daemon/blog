## Work
Spent the week finishing off some final planning and bug fixes to be ready to take next week off.
I procrastinated too much, so I had to finish some last-minute technical planning on Sunday.
I make this mistake often; you should complete work early to have more time to relax.

## Media
I have a handful of books ongoing (stats + economics), but nothing has been finished this week.

## Personal
I decided to splash out and buy a 3d printer. I had three reasons for doing so: to better organise my space,
to improve my 3d modelling skills and to have more opportunities to work with electronics.

For organisation, I have had my eyes on the GridFinity organisers for drawers. They are convenient and
help avoid cluttered drawers where you cannot find things. I also need a small box/rack for my Raspberry
Pi cluster and something to organise the cabling. They print quickly, so you can print as you go along
with tidying. One highlight was printing a Xenomorph bust as a headphone stand.

I've already made minor adjustments to the models I've been printing. Things like adjusting the mouse
and keyboard stand to fit together. So far, I've been doing the work within Bambu Studio. I will eventually
move to more heavyweight modelling options as appropriate.

For the electronics project, I am looking to make some [GUN4IR](https://www.gun4ir.com/) guns for
arcade-style games. I plan on making two so I can go through some old arcade shooter classics
(Jurassic Park, House of the Dead, etc).

I have time to pursue some of these projects with next week off. However, I intend to take things easy.
