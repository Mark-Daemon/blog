## Work
Work has opened up an internal role for "Chapter Lead", and I have been encouraged to apply. The role would come with no pay raise (at least until the next promotion cycle) and involve managing around 60 engineers. This is in line with my ambitions from just a few years ago. However, nowadays, I have lost my previous ambition of climbing the ladder in this industry. I am also put off by the misaligned expectations: they expect this additional work to occupy only 10% of my time. Although, I am tempted to apply just for the change of pace.

While this is ongoing, we have a major mobile-centric project coming up. We are coordinating across many teams, and a great deal of planning and design work is in the motions of completion; the company has emphasised the importance of this project for our financial future. It's a UI redesign with no actual mechanical changes.
I may have had some gripes with the old management, yet now I look upon those old days fondly.

#### The Forest Passage by Ernst Jünger
Jünger starts his book with a critique of voting from the perspective that participating in the machinations of an authoritarian regime legitimises it. Even when voting against the ruling party, that a minority oppose serves to justify the facade of democracy. The emphasis here is that freedom means an exit from such external mechanisms of control, not through the permitted (and accounted for) forms of dissent. Jünger argues further that voting is also a form of surveillance.

Having potential defectors obediently register their dissent, grouped by their constituencies, allows the regime to keep a closer check on them. This prescient rise of the surveillance state, as technology evolves to grant governments a righter grip on its population, is a risk to individual freedom. Under these circumstances of an increasingly technological state intruding deeper into its citizens' personal lives, Jünger begins to build his concept of the Forest Rebel.

> *A gamble of this kind can only hope to succeed if the three great powers of art, philosophy,*
> *and theology come to its aid and break fresh ground in the dead-end situation.*

Jünger's "Forest Rebel" begins with a philosophical rejection of the modern state, described as retreating into a "Forest". This starts with emphasising courage, self-awareness, self-reliance, and a reconnection to myth and nature. That is not to say it is a retreat into isolation or imagination (as Jünger criticises, for example, a certain Christian nihilism), but that imagination provides a force for Action.

> *Two characteristics are thus essential for the Forest Rebel: he allows no superior power to*
> *dictate the law to him, neither through propaganda nor force; and he means to defend himself,*
> *not only by exploiting the instruments and the ideas of the times, but also by maintaining*
> *access to those time-transcending powers that can never be reduced to pure movement*

The Forest Rebel does not confine himself to remain hidden within his internal world. Jünger recounts a tale of an Icelandic man gunning down several Nazi police officers in defence of his home - offering it is an example of courage and defiance. In later chapters, Jünger establishes Action in the "here and now", from public messages of dissent to acts of sabotage while remaining concealed from the ever-watching eye of the "Leviathan". While he establishes that such actions, and that the role of Forest Rebel is only possible to a few capable men, he offers a warning to those who would not resist.

It was not just the Germans who actively supported the Nazis were punished after the war. Those who continued living their lives in passive acceptance, those who did not actively resist, were punished alongside them. As he says, they did not yet know the new rules of the game.
#### A Handbook for Dissidents by Dominique Venner
Venner's work focused on the historical and philosophical, particularly in regard to the founding myths of the European people. It is in this form that Venner offers direction to the next generation.

This key theme offers a vision for the future as well as a Nietzschean critique of modern values and the influence of Christianity over Europe. A key resurgent idea is that Europe developed from a Greco-Christian rather than Judeo-Christian influence.

The influence of the Greeks stretches across Europe, particularly through the medium of myths. Homer's Odyssey and Iliad have shaped European thought from the medieval ages, inspiring and influencing their conception of heroism and chivalry. Venner highlights, in particular, these myths' lack of moral condemnation. The hero is good because he represents certain ideals, not aligning or following a set of laws. This stands in contrast to Christianity and is where Venner's critique of Christianity begins.

> *"Always be the best, my boy, and shine above others"*

> *"Who asks for permission to enter?"*  
> *"Zita, her majesty and empress and queen"*  
> *"I do not know her"*  
> *The master of ceremonies knocks a third time.*  
> *"Who asks for permission to enter?"*  
> *"Zita, a mortal being, a sinner"*  

Achilles did not turn the other cheek; in fact, he lashes out in anger to exact his vengeance. Yet, in the heat of the moment, he finds it in himself to also exhibit mercy. Neither does Achilles reduce himself to less-than; rather, his father encourages him to strive for excellence and to stand out above others. Christianity, on the other hand, dismisses this as "all are equal before the eyes of god". Venner goes on to describe Christianity as an Imperial religion, one convenient for an empire in its ability to declare all equal and unite a heterogeneous population. This inversion of values, criticising the strong, is classically Nietzschean and leads into a discussion of Stoicism.

To Venner, Stoicism is aristocratic. Self-restraint and self-control are used to develop greater discipline and capacity for action. A practice that separates the common man from those more capable. He observes a commonality between the Japanese Bushido and the Roman stoic: the act of "voluntary death", the art of dying well. Venner goes on to share a similar (and Nietzschean) critique of Stoicism regarding its ascetic practices, to paraphrase: "When kissing your wife, remind yourself that this is a mortal being so her death does not harm you". This tendency towards radical detachment, depriving yourself for what reason precisely? To avoid pain? This is too far, I would rather have the shoulders to bear such pain than deprive myself of these small moments of joy.

Venner also shares a critique of the pursuit of money reminiscent of that shared in Aristotle's _Politics_. The pursuit of money is a means to an end: the baker wishes to exchange his bread for another product - money becomes the means for doing so. When the pursuit of money is the end itself, this perverts its intentions and distorts its influence on society. Rather than pursuing what is useful or good, one pursues money. These critiques always bring me back to an old regret, yet a regret I would always repeat.

Upon coming to the end of my time at University, I was encouraged and offered the opportunity to stay and pursue research. My immediate reaction was to compare the proposed salary against that of private industry, and thus my decision was quickly made. This is the only regret in life I come back to visit; I would have enjoyed a life pursuing research. Yet I know if I were to go back, I would always make this same decision and live with that same regret. Money makes life comfortable, and I reassure myself (accurately) that I was not ready to pursue research at that young age. Alas, back to the book.

In the ending chapter, Venner shares some small life advice that can be briefly summarised: write, read (and share this with your children), remain physically active, cultivate beauty, and embrace pan-Europeanism.

Of particular note in regard to cultivating beauty is the choice of artwork and photography throughout the book, which is tasteful. I chose the image of The Knight, Death and the Devil from the cover to 3d print as an engraving to hang on my wall.

I started this blog as a place to encourage and improve my writing. However, I now have a concrete objective. I have grown bored of my current career and its trajectory, yet I do not know where to go next. As it provides for a comfortable living, I am not in a rush for change. The plan is to explore (and write about) various topics of interest as a means of searching for where to go next.
